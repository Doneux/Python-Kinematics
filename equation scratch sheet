Primary kinematic equations we will work with:
x represents position
displacement d represents xi - xf (initial - final)
t represents time
v = d/t #velocity
a = v/t #acceleration
instantenous acceleration and velocity will be handled later
let r represent a radius about which two dimensonal motion occurs, then:
ac = v^2/r #centripetal acceleration

let m represent the mass of an object in a free-body diagram, and let f represent the summation of force vectors acting upon that object (Fnet), then:
f = ma #force
let g represent earth's gravitational acceleration constant, 9.8m/s^2, then
n = mg #normal force
let o represent some angle upon which an object rests, then
n = mg*cos(o) #normal force again
let k represent a spring constant, and in this case, x represent the displacement of the spring from it's position at rest, then
f = -kx # spring force
