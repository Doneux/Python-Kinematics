Python Kinematics

Project by Seth Doneux

NOTE: Under heavy development. See index below for user details.
Python Kinematics is a physics calculator developed by Seth Doneux with the goal of allowing users to enter their known variables and determine their unknown variables using equations from Newtonian Mechanics.
The project is a solo endeavor by Seth Doneux.

Index:

kinematics.py - A user-ready, barebones version of the program. Run with python3. Choose equations from available selections, choose unknown to solve for, and enter knowns.

vectors.py - Borrowed vector solver from my custom-written mathematics library (https://github.com/Doneux/Seth-s-Mathematics-Library) integrated into this calculator for ease of access.

More equations will be implemented soon.
